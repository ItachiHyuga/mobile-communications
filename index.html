          <h1>Introduction</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="app-section">
          <p id="p2">The ability to communicate with people on the move has evolved remarkably since Guglielmo Marconi
            first
            demonstrated radio&#39;s ability to provide continuous contact with ships sailing the English channel. That
            was in 1897, and since then new wireless communications methods and services have been enthusiastically
            adopted by people throughout the world.</p>
          <p>Particularly during the past ten years, the mobile radio communications industry has grown by orders of
            magnitude, fueled by digital and RF circuit fabrication improvements, new large-scale circuit integration,
            and other miniaturization technologies which make portable radio equipment smaller, cheaper, and more
            reliable.Wireless communications is enjoying its fastest growth period in history,due to enabling
            technologies which permit wide spread deployment.</p>
          <p>Historically.growth in the mobile communications field has come slowly, and has been coupled closely to
            technological improvements. The ability to provide wireless communicationsto an entire population was not
            even conceived until BellLaboratories developed the cellular concept in the 1960s and 1970s. With the
            development of highly reliable, miniature, solid-stateradio frequency hardware in the 1970s, the wireless
            communications era was born.</p>
          <p>The below figure shows that the first 35 years of mobile telephone saw little market penetration due to
            high cost and the technological challenges involved, but how, in the past decade, cellular telephone has
            been accepted by consumers at rates comparable to the television, and the video cassette recorder.</p>

          <p>Cellular radio systems operate in an interference-limited environment and rely on judicious frequency reuse
            plans (which are a function of the market-specific propagation characteristics) and frequency division
            multiple access (FDMA) to maximize capacity.</p>

            mobile. Note that the fonvard and reverse channels in each pair are separated by 45 MHz </p>
          <p>A cellular system based on code division multiple access (CDMA) has been
            developed by Qualcomm, Inc. and standardized by the Thlecommunications
            Industry Association (TIA) as an Interim Standard . The ability of CDMA to operate with a much smaller
            signal-to-noise ratio than conventional narrowband FM techniques
            allows CDMA systems to use the same set of frequencies in every cell,
            which provides a large improvement in capacity </p>

          <p><b> Examples of Mobile Radio Systems : </b></p><br>
          <p>The term mobile has historically been used to classify any radio terminal
            that could be moved during operation. More recently, the term mobile is used to
            describe a radio terminal that is attached to a high speed mobile platform (e.g. a
            cellular telephone in a fast moving vehicl& whereas the term portable describes
            a radio terminal that can be hand-held and used by someone at walking speedMobile radio transmission systems
            may be classified as simplex, halfduplex
            or full-duplex. In simplex systems, communication is possible in only one
            direction. Paging systems, in which messages are received but not acknowledged,
            are simplex systems. Half-duplex radio systems allow two-way communication,
            but use the same radio channel for both transmission and reception. </p>

          <h1>Frequency division duplexing (FDD)</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="app-section">
          <p>Frequency division duplexing (FDD) provides simultaneous radio transmission
            channels for the subscriber and the base station, so that they both may constantly
            transmit while simultaneously receiving signals from one another. At the
            base station, separate transmit and receive' antennas are used to accommodate
            the two separate channels. At the subscriber unit, however, a single antenna is
            used for both transmission to and reception from the base station, and a device
            called a duplexer is used inside the subscriber unit to enable the same antenna
            to be used for simultaneous transmission and reception. To facilitate FDD, it is
            necessary to separate the transmit and receive frequencies by about 5% of the
            nominal RF frequency, so that the duplexer can provide sufficient isolation while
            being inexpensively manufactured.</p>
          <p>In FDD, a pair of simplex channels with a fixed and known frequency separation
            is used to define a specific radio channel in the system. The channel used
            to convey traffic to the mobile user from a base station is called the forward
            channel, while the channel used to carry traffic from, the mobile user to a base
            station is called the reverse channel. In the U.S. AMPS standard, the reverse
            channel has a frequency which is exactly 45 MHz lower than that of the forward
            channel, Full duplex mobile radio systems provide many of the capabilities of the
            standard telephone, with the added convenience of mobility. Full duplex and
            half-duplex systems use transceivers for radio communication. FDD is used
            exclusively in analog mobile radio systems and is described in more detail in </p>

        </div>
        <div class="app-section">
          <p>Time division duplexing (TDD)
            uses the fact that it is possible to share a single radio channel in time, so that a portion of the time
            is used to transmit from the base station to the mobile, and the remaining time is used to transmit from
            the mobile to the base station. If the data transmission rate in the channel is much greater than the
            end-user's data rate, it is possible to store information bursts and provide the appearance of frill
            duplex operation to a user, even though there are not two simultaneous radio transmissions at any instant
            of time. TDD is only possible with digital transmission formats and digital modulation, and is very
            sensitive to timing. It is for this reason that TDD has only recently been used, and only for indoor or
            small area wireless applications where the physical coverage distances (and thus the radio propagation
            time delay) are much smaller than the many kilometers used in conventional cellular telephone systems.</p>

          <h1>Paging Systems</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="app-section">
          <p>Paging systems are communication systems that send brief messages to a
            subscriber. Depending on the type of service, the message may be either a
            numeric message, an alphanumeric message, or a voice message. Paging systems
            are typically used to noti& a subscriber of the need to call a particular telephone number or travel to a
            known location to receive further instructions. In modern paging systems, news headlines, stock
            quotations, and faxes may be sent. A message
            is sent to a paging subscriber via the paging system access number (usually
            a toll-free telephone number) with a telephone keypad or modem. The issued
            message is called a page. The paging system then transmits the page throughout
            the service area using base stations which broadcast the page on a radio carrier.</p>
          <p>
            Paging systems vary widely in their complexity and coverage area. While
            simple paging systems may cover a limited range of 2 km to 5 km, or may even
            be confined to within individual buildings, wide area paging systems can provide
            worldwide coverage. Though paging receivers are simple and inexpensive, the
            transmission system required is quite sophisticated. Wide area paging systems
            consist of a network of telephone lines, many base station transmitters, and
            large radio towers that simultaneously broadcast a page from each base station
            (this is called simulcasting). Simulcast transmitters may be located within the
            same service area or in different cities or countries. Paging systems are designed
            to provide reliable communication to subscribers wherever they are; whether
            inside a building, driving on a highway, or flying in an airplane. </p><br>

          <h1>Cellular Telephone Systems</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="app-section">
          <p>A cellular telephone system provides a wireless connection to the PSTN for
            any user location within the radio range of the system. Cellular systems accommodate
            a large number of users over a large geographic area, within a limited
            frequency spectrum. Cellular radio systems provide high quality service that is
            often comparable to that of the landline telephone systems. High capacity is
            achieved by limiting the coverage of each base station transmitter to a small geographic
            area called a cell so that the same radio channels may be reused by
            another base station located some distance away. A sophisticated switching technique
            called a handoff enables a call to proceed uninterrupted when the user
            moves from one cell to another.</p>
          <p>
            Figure shows a basic cellular system which consists of mobile stations,
            base stations and a mobile switching center (MSC). The Mobile Switching Center
            is sometimes called a mobile telephone switching office (MTSO), since it is
            responsible for connecting all mobiles to the PSTN in a cellular system. Each
            mobile communicates via radio with one of the base stations and may be handedoff
            to any number of base stations throughout the duration of a call. The mobile
            station contains a transceiver, an antenna, and control circuitry, and may be
            mounted in a vehicle or used as a portable hand-held unit, The base stations consist
            of several transmitters and receivers which simultaneously handle full
            duplex communications and generally have towers which support several transmitting
            and receiving antennas. The base station serves as a bridge between all
            mobile users in the cell and connects the simultaneous mobile calls via telephone
            lines or microwave links to the MSC. The MSC coordinates the activities of all of
            the base stations and connects the entire cellular system to the PSTN. A typical
            MSC handles 100,000 cellular subscribers arid 5,000 simultaneous conversations
            at a time, and accommodates all billing and system maintenance functions, as
            well. In large cities, several MSCs are used by a single carrier.</p>
          <p>
            Communication between the base station and the mobiles is defined by a
            standard common air interface (CM) that specifies four different channels. The
            channels used for voice transmission from the base station to mobiles are called
            forward voice channels (PVC) and the channels used for voice transmission from
            mobiles to the base station are called reverse voice channels (RVC). The two
            channels responsible for initiating mobile calls are the forward control channels
            (FCC) and reverse control channels (RCC). Control channels are often called
            setup channels because they are only involved in setting up a call and moving it
            to an unused voice channel. Control channels transmit and receive data messages
            that carry call initiation and service requests, and are monitored by
            mobiles when they do not have a call in progress. </p><br>

          <h1>Frequency Reuses</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="app-section">
          <p>Cellular radio systems rely on an intelligent allocation and reuse of channels
            throughout a coverage region [0et83]. Each cellular base station is allocated
            a group of radio channels to be used within a small geographic area called a cell.
            Base stations in adjacent cells are assigned channel groups which contain completely
            different channels than neighboring cells. The base station antennas are
            designed to achieve the desired coverage within the particular cell. By limiting
            the coverage area to within the boundaries of a cell, the same group of channels
            may be used to cover different cells that are separated from one another by distances
            large enough to keep interference levels within tolerable limits. The
            design process of selecting and allocating channel groups for all of the cellular
            base stations within a system is called frequency reuse or frequency planning </p>

          <p>Figure shows Illustration of the cellular frequency reuse concept. Cells with the same letter use the
            same set of frequencies. A cell cluster is outlined in bold and replicated over the coverage area. In this
            example, the cluster size, N, is equal to seven, and the frequency reuse factor is 1/7 since each cell
            contains one-seventh of the total number of available channels </p>
          <p>
            To understand the frequency reuse concept, consider a cellular system
            which has a total of S duplex channels available for use. If each cell is allocated
            a group of k channels (k cS), and if the S channels are divided among N cells
            into unique and disjoint channel groups which each have the same number of
            channels, the total number of available radio channels can be expressed as</p>
          <p class="formula">S = kN
          </p>
          <p>The N cells which collectively use the complete set of available frequencies
            is called a cluster. If a cluster is replicated M times within the system, the total
            number of duplex channels, C, can be used as a measure of capacity and is given</p>
          <p class="formula"> C = MkN = MS
          </p>
          <p>As seen from equation , the capacity of a cellular system is directly proportional
            to the number of times a cluster is replicated in a fixed service area.
            The factor N is called the cluster size and is typically equal to 4, 7, or 12. If the
            cluster size N is reduced while the cell size is kept constant, more clusters are
            required to cover a given area and hence more capacity (a larger value of C) is
            achieved. A large cluster size indicates that the ratio between the cell radius and
            the distance between co-channel cells is large. Conversely, a small cluster size
            indicates that co-channel cells are located much closer together. The value for N
            is a function of how much interference a mobile or base station can tolerate while
            maintaining a sufficient quality of communications. From a design viewpoint,
            the smallest possible value of N is desirable in order to maximize capacity over a
            given coverage area (i.e.. to maximize C in equation (2.2)). The frequency reuse
            factor of a cellular system is given by I /N, since each cell within a cluster is
            only assigned II'N of the total available channels in the system.</p>

        <h1>Channel Assignment Strategies</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="app-section">
        <p>For efficient utilization of the radio spectrum, a frequency reuse scheme
          that is consistent with the objectives of increasing capacity and minimizing
          interference is required. A variety of channel assignment strategies have been
          developed to achieve these objectives. Channel assignment strategies can be
          classified as either fixed or dynamic.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="app-section">
        <p>

          <b>Fixed Channel Assignment : </b></p>
        <p>
          In a fixed channel assignment strategy; each cell is allocated a predetermined
          set of voice channels. Any call attempt within the cell can only be served
          by the unused channels in that particular cell. If all the channels in that cell are
          occupied, the call is blocked and the subscriber does not receive service. Several
          variations of the fixed assignment strategy exist. In one approach, called the borrowing
          strategy, a cell is allowed to borrow channels from a neighboring cell if all
          of its own channels are already occupied. The mobile switching center (MSC)
          supervises such borrowing procedures and ensures that the borrowing of a channel
          does not disrupt or interfere with any of the calls in progress in the donor
          cell.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="app-section">
        <p>

          <b>Dynamic Channel Assignment</b></p>
        <p>
          In a dynamic channel assignment strategy, voice channels are not allocated
          to different cells permanently. Instead, each time a call request is made, the
          serving base station requests a channel from the MSC. The switch then allocates
          a channel to the requested cell following an algorithm that takes into account the
          likelihood of fixture blocking within the cell, the frequency of use of the candidate
          channel, the reuse distance of the channel, and other cost functions.</p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, the MSC only allocates a given frequency if that frequency is
          not presently in use in the cell or any other cell which falls within the minimum
          restricted distance of frequency reuse to avoid co-channel interference. Dynamic
          channel assignment reduce the likelihood of blocking, which increases the trunking
          capacity of the system, since all the available channels in a market are accessible
          to all of the cells. Dynamic channel assignment strategies require the MSC. to collect real-time data on
          channel occupancy, traffic distribution, arid radio signal
          strength indications (RSS!) of all channels on a continuous basis. This
          increases the storage and computational load on the system but provides the
          advantage of increased channel utilization and decreased probability of a
          blocked call.</p>

          <h1>Handoff Strategies</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="app-section">
          <p>When a mobile moves into a different cell while a conversation is in
            progress, the MSC automatically transfers the call to a new channel belonging to
            the new base station. This handoff operation not only involves identifying a new
            base station, but also requires that the voice and control signals be allocated to
            channels associated with the new base station.</p>
          <p>
            Processing handoffs is an important task in any cellular radio system.
            when allocating unused channels in a cell site. Handofts must be performed successfully
            and as infrequently as possible, and be imperceptible to the users. In
            order to meet these requirements, system designers must speci& an optimum
            signal level at which to initiate a handoff. Once a particular signal level is specified
            as the minimum usable signal for acceptable voice quality at the base station
            receiver (normally taken as between —90 dBm and —100 dBm), a slightly
            stronger signal level is used as a threshold at which a handoff is made. This margin,
            given by </p>
          <p class=”formula”>▲ = Pr (handoff) - Pr(minimum usable) </p>
          <p>
            It cannot be too large or too small. If
            ▲ is too large, unnecessary handoffs which burden the MSC may occur, and if A
            is too small, there may be insufficient time to complete a handoff before a call is
            lost due to weak signal conditions. Therefore, A is chosen carefully to meet these
            conflicting requirements. Figure 2.3 illustrates a handoff situation. Figure 2.3(a)
            demonstrates the case where a handoff is not made and the signal drops below
            the minimum acceptable level to keep the channel active. This dropped call
            event can happen when there is an excessive delay by the MSC in assigning a
            handoff, or when the threshold z\ is set too small for the handoff time in the system.
            Excessive delays may occur during high traffic conditions due to computational
            loading at the MSC or due to the fact that no channels are available on
            any of the nearby base stations (thus forcing the MSC to wait until a channel in
            a nearby cell becomes free).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="app-section">

          <p><b>Dwell time</b></p>
          <p>
            The time over which a call may be maintained within a cell, without handoff,
            is called the dwell time of a particular user is governed
            by a number of factors, which include propagation, interference, distance
            between the subscriber and the base station, and other time varying effects.
            even when a mobile user is stationary, ambient motion in
            the vicinity of the base station and the mobile can produce fading, thus even a
            stationary subscriber may have a random and finite dwell time. </p>


        </div>
        <div class="app-section">
          <p><b>Prioritizing Handoffs</b></p>
          <p>
            One method for giving priority to handoffs is called the guard channel concept,
            whereby a fraction of the total available channels in a cell is reserved exclusively
            for handoff requests from ongoing calls which may be handed off into the
            cell. This method has the disadvantage of reducing the total carried traffic, as
            fewer channels are allocated to originating calls. Guard channels, however, offer
            efficient spectrum utilization when dynamic channel assignment strategies,
            which minimize the number of required guard channels by efficient demand based
            allocation, are used.</p>
          <p>Queuing of handoff requests is another method to decrease the probability of forced termination of a call
            due to lack of available channels. There is a trade off between the decrease in probability of forced
            termination and total carried
            traffic. Queuing of handoffs is possible due to the fact that there is a finite time
            interval between the time the received signal level drops below the handoff
            threshold and the time the call is terminated due to insufficient signal level. The
            delay time and size of the queue is determined from the traffic pattern of the particular
            service area. It should be noted that queuing does not guarantee a zero
            probability of forced termination, since large delays will cause the received signal
            level to drop below the minimum required level to maintain communication
            and hence lead to forced termination.</p>


        </div>
        <div class="app-section">
          <p><b>Practical Handoff Considerations</b></p>
          <p>
            In practical cellular systems, several problems arise when attempting to
            design for a wide range of mobile velocities. High speed vehicles pass through
            the coverage region of a cell within a matter of seconds, whereas pedestrian
            users may never need a handoff during a call. Particularly with the addition of
            microcells to provide capacity, the MSC can quickly become burdened if high
            speed users are constantly being passed between very small cells. Several
            schemes have been devised to handle the simultaneous traffic of high speed and
            low speed users while minimizing the handoff intervention from the MSC.</p>
          <p>

            Another practical limitation is the ability to obtain new cell sites.
            Although the cellular concept clearly provides additional capacity through
            the addition of cell sites, in practice it is difficult for cellular service providers to
            obtain new physical cell site locations in urban areas. Zoning laws, ordinances,
            and other nontechnical bathers often make it more attractive for a cellular provider
            to install additional channels and base stations at the same physical location
            of an existing cell, rather than find new site locations. By using different
            antenna heights (often on the same building or tower) and different power levels,
            it is possible to provide "large" and "small" cells which are co-located at a single
            location. This technique is called the umbrella cell approach and is used to provide
            large area coverage to high speed users while providing small area coverage
            to users traveling at low speeds.</p>
          <p>
            Figure 2.4 illustrates an umbrella cell which is
            co-located with some smaller microcells. The umbrella cell approach ensures
            that the number of handoffs is minimized for high speed users and provides
            additional microcell channels for pedestrian users. The speed of each user may
            be estimated by the base station or MSC by evaluating how rapidly the short term
            average signal strength on the RVC changes over time, or more sophisticated
            algorithms may be used to evaluate and partition users [LiCS3]. If a high
            speed user in the large umbrella cell is approaching the base station, and its
            velocity is rapidly decreasing, the base station may decide to hand the user into
            the co-located microcell, without MSC intervention. </p>

          <p><b>Cell dragging </b></p>
          <p>
            Another practical handoff problem in microcell systems is known as cell
            dragging. Cell dragging results from pedestrian users that provide a very strong
            signal to the base station. Such a situation occurs in an urban environment when
            there is a line-of-sight (LOS) radio path between the subscriber and the base station. As the user travels
            away from the base station at a very slow speed, the
            average signal strength does not decay rapidly. Even when the user has traveled
            well beyond the designed range of the cell, the received signal at the base station
            may be above the handoff threshold, thus a handoff may not be made. This creates
            a potential interference and traffic management problem, since the user has
            meanwhile traveled deep within a neighboring cell. Th solve the cell dragging
            problem, handoff thresholds and radio coverage parameters must be adjusted
            carefully.</p>
          <p>
            In first generation analog cellular systems, the typical time to make a
            handoff, once the signal level is deemed to be below the handoff threshold, is
            about 10 seconds. This requires that the value for a be on the order of 6 dB to
            12 dB. In new digital cellular systems such as GSM, the mobile assists with the
            handoff procedure by determining the best handoff candidates, and the handoff,
            once the decision is made, typically requires only 1 or 2 seconds. Consequently, a
            is usually between 0 dB and 6 dB in modem cellular systems. The faster handoff
            process supports a much greater range of options for handling high speed and
            low speed users and provides the MSC with substantial time to "rescue" a call
            that is in need of handoff.</p>
          <p>
            Another feature of newer cellular systems is the ability to make handoff
            decisions based on a wide range of metrics other than signal strength. The co channel
            and adjacent channel interference levels may be measured at the base
            station or the mobile, and this information may be used with conventional signal
            strength data to provide a multi-dimensional algorithm for determining when a
            handoff is needed.</p>
