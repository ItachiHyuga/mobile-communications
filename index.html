          <h1>Introduction</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="app-section">
          <p id="p2">The ability to communicate with people on the move has evolved remarkably since Guglielmo Marconi
            first
            demonstrated radio&#39;s ability to provide continuous contact with ships sailing the English channel. That
            was in 1897, and since then new wireless communications methods and services have been enthusiastically
            adopted by people throughout the world.</p>
          <p>Particularly during the past ten years, the mobile radio communications industry has grown by orders of
            magnitude, fueled by digital and RF circuit fabrication improvements, new large-scale circuit integration,
            and other miniaturization technologies which make portable radio equipment smaller, cheaper, and more
            reliable.Wireless communications is enjoying its fastest growth period in history,due to enabling
            technologies which permit wide spread deployment.</p>
          <p>Historically.growth in the mobile communications field has come slowly, and has been coupled closely to
            technological improvements. The ability to provide wireless communicationsto an entire population was not
            even conceived until BellLaboratories developed the cellular concept in the 1960s and 1970s. With the
            development of highly reliable, miniature, solid-stateradio frequency hardware in the 1970s, the wireless
            communications era was born.</p>
          <p>The below figure shows that the first 35 years of mobile telephone saw little market penetration due to
            high cost and the technological challenges involved, but how, in the past decade, cellular telephone has
            been accepted by consumers at rates comparable to the television, and the video cassette recorder.</p>

          <p>Cellular radio systems operate in an interference-limited environment and rely on judicious frequency reuse
            plans (which are a function of the market-specific propagation characteristics) and frequency division
            multiple access (FDMA) to maximize capacity.</p>

          <p>The above figure shows Frequency spectrum allocation for the U.S. cellular radio service. Identically
            labeled channels in the
            two bands form a forward and reverse channel pair used for duplex communication between the base station and
            mobile. Note that the fonvard and reverse channels in each pair are separated by 45 MHz </p>
          <p>A cellular system based on code division multiple access (CDMA) has been
            developed by Qualcomm, Inc. and standardized by the Thlecommunications
            Industry Association (TIA) as an Interim Standard . The ability of CDMA to operate with a much smaller
            signal-to-noise ratio than conventional narrowband FM techniques
            allows CDMA systems to use the same set of frequencies in every cell,
            which provides a large improvement in capacity </p>

          <p><b> Examples of Mobile Radio Systems : </b></p><br>
          <p>The term mobile has historically been used to classify any radio terminal
            that could be moved during operation. More recently, the term mobile is used to
            describe a radio terminal that is attached to a high speed mobile platform (e.g. a
            cellular telephone in a fast moving vehicl& whereas the term portable describes
            a radio terminal that can be hand-held and used by someone at walking speedMobile radio transmission systems
            may be classified as simplex, halfduplex
            or full-duplex. In simplex systems, communication is possible in only one
            direction. Paging systems, in which messages are received but not acknowledged,
            are simplex systems. Half-duplex radio systems allow two-way communication,
            but use the same radio channel for both transmission and reception. </p>

          </div>
          <div class="app-section">
            <p>Frequency division duplexing (FDD) provides simultaneous radio transmission
              channels for the subscriber and the base station, so that they both may constantly
              transmit while simultaneously receiving signals from one another. At the
              base station, separate transmit and receive' antennas are used to accommodate
              the two separate channels. At the subscriber unit, however, a single antenna is
              used for both transmission to and reception from the base station, and a device
              called a duplexer is used inside the subscriber unit to enable the same antenna
              to be used for simultaneous transmission and reception. To facilitate FDD, it is
              necessary to separate the transmit and receive frequencies by about 5% of the
              nominal RF frequency, so that the duplexer can provide sufficient isolation while
              being inexpensively manufactured.</p>
            <p>In FDD, a pair of simplex channels with a fixed and known frequency separation
              is used to define a specific radio channel in the system. The channel used
              to convey traffic to the mobile user from a base station is called the forward
              channel, while the channel used to carry traffic from, the mobile user to a base
              station is called the reverse channel. In the U.S. AMPS standard, the reverse
              channel has a frequency which is exactly 45 MHz lower than that of the forward
              channel, Full duplex mobile radio systems provide many of the capabilities of the
              standard telephone, with the added convenience of mobility. Full duplex and
              half-duplex systems use transceivers for radio communication. FDD is used
              exclusively in analog mobile radio systems and is described in more detail in </p>

          <div class="app-section">
            <p>Time division duplexing (TDD)
              uses the fact that it is possible to share a single radio channel in time, so that a portion of the time
              is used to transmit from the base station to the mobile, and the remaining time is used to transmit from
              the mobile to the base station. If the data transmission rate in the channel is much greater than the
              end-user's data rate, it is possible to store information bursts and provide the appearance of frill
              duplex operation to a user, even though there are not two simultaneous radio transmissions at any instant
              of time. TDD is only possible with digital transmission formats and digital modulation, and is very
              sensitive to timing. It is for this reason that TDD has only recently been used, and only for indoor or
              small area wireless applications where the physical coverage distances (and thus the radio propagation
              time delay) are much smaller than the many kilometers used in conventional cellular telephone systems.</p>

            <h1>Paging Systems</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="app-section">
            <p>Paging systems are communication systems that send brief messages to a
              subscriber. Depending on the type of service, the message may be either a
              numeric message, an alphanumeric message, or a voice message. Paging systems
              are typically used to noti& a subscriber of the need to call a particular telephone number or travel to a
              known location to receive further instructions. In modern paging systems, news headlines, stock
              quotations, and faxes may be sent. A message
              is sent to a paging subscriber via the paging system access number (usually
              a toll-free telephone number) with a telephone keypad or modem. The issued
              message is called a page. The paging system then transmits the page throughout
              the service area using base stations which broadcast the page on a radio carrier.</p>
            <p>
              Paging systems vary widely in their complexity and coverage area. While
              simple paging systems may cover a limited range of 2 km to 5 km, or may even
              be confined to within individual buildings, wide area paging systems can provide
              worldwide coverage. Though paging receivers are simple and inexpensive, the
              transmission system required is quite sophisticated. Wide area paging systems
              consist of a network of telephone lines, many base station transmitters, and
              large radio towers that simultaneously broadcast a page from each base station
              (this is called simulcasting). Simulcast transmitters may be located within the
              same service area or in different cities or countries. Paging systems are designed
              to provide reliable communication to subscribers wherever they are; whether
              inside a building, driving on a highway, or flying in an airplane. </p><br>

          </div>
          <div class="app-section">
            <p>A cellular telephone system provides a wireless connection to the PSTN for
              any user location within the radio range of the system. Cellular systems accommodate
              a large number of users over a large geographic area, within a limited
              frequency spectrum. Cellular radio systems provide high quality service that is
              often comparable to that of the landline telephone systems. High capacity is
              achieved by limiting the coverage of each base station transmitter to a small geographic
              area called a cell so that the same radio channels may be reused by
              another base station located some distance away. A sophisticated switching technique
              called a handoff enables a call to proceed uninterrupted when the user
              moves from one cell to another.</p>
            <p>
              Figure shows a basic cellular system which consists of mobile stations,
              base stations and a mobile switching center (MSC). The Mobile Switching Center
              is sometimes called a mobile telephone switching office (MTSO), since it is
              responsible for connecting all mobiles to the PSTN in a cellular system. Each
              mobile communicates via radio with one of the base stations and may be handedoff
              to any number of base stations throughout the duration of a call. The mobile
              station contains a transceiver, an antenna, and control circuitry, and may be
              mounted in a vehicle or used as a portable hand-held unit, The base stations consist
              of several transmitters and receivers which simultaneously handle full
              duplex communications and generally have towers which support several transmitting
              and receiving antennas. The base station serves as a bridge between all
              mobile users in the cell and connects the simultaneous mobile calls via telephone
              lines or microwave links to the MSC. The MSC coordinates the activities of all of
              the base stations and connects the entire cellular system to the PSTN. A typical
              MSC handles 100,000 cellular subscribers arid 5,000 simultaneous conversations
              at a time, and accommodates all billing and system maintenance functions, as
              well. In large cities, several MSCs are used by a single carrier.</p>
            <p>
              Communication between the base station and the mobiles is defined by a
              standard common air interface (CM) that specifies four different channels. The
              channels used for voice transmission from the base station to mobiles are called
              forward voice channels (PVC) and the channels used for voice transmission from
              mobiles to the base station are called reverse voice channels (RVC). The two
              channels responsible for initiating mobile calls are the forward control channels
              (FCC) and reverse control channels (RCC). Control channels are often called
              setup channels because they are only involved in setting up a call and moving it
              to an unused voice channel. Control channels transmit and receive data messages
              that carry call initiation and service requests, and are monitored by
              mobiles when they do not have a call in progress. </p><br>

            <h1>Frequency Reuses</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="app-section">
            <p>Cellular radio systems rely on an intelligent allocation and reuse of channels
              throughout a coverage region [0et83]. Each cellular base station is allocated
              a group of radio channels to be used within a small geographic area called a cell.
              Base stations in adjacent cells are assigned channel groups which contain completely
              different channels than neighboring cells. The base station antennas are
              designed to achieve the desired coverage within the particular cell. By limiting
              the coverage area to within the boundaries of a cell, the same group of channels
              may be used to cover different cells that are separated from one another by distances
              large enough to keep interference levels within tolerable limits. The
              design process of selecting and allocating channel groups for all of the cellular
              base stations within a system is called frequency reuse or frequency planning </p>

            <p>Figure shows Illustration of the cellular frequency reuse concept. Cells with the same letter use the
              same set of frequencies. A cell cluster is outlined in bold and replicated over the coverage area. In this
              example, the cluster size, N, is equal to seven, and the frequency reuse factor is 1/7 since each cell
              contains one-seventh of the total number of available channels </p>
            <p>
              To understand the frequency reuse concept, consider a cellular system
              which has a total of S duplex channels available for use. If each cell is allocated
              a group of k channels (k cS), and if the S channels are divided among N cells
              into unique and disjoint channel groups which each have the same number of
              channels, the total number of available radio channels can be expressed as</p>
            <p class="formula">S = kN
            </p>
            <p>The N cells which collectively use the complete set of available frequencies
              is called a cluster. If a cluster is replicated M times within the system, the total
              number of duplex channels, C, can be used as a measure of capacity and is given</p>
            <p class="formula"> C = MkN = MS
            </p>
            <p>As seen from equation , the capacity of a cellular system is directly proportional
              to the number of times a cluster is replicated in a fixed service area.
              The factor N is called the cluster size and is typically equal to 4, 7, or 12. If the
              cluster size N is reduced while the cell size is kept constant, more clusters are
              required to cover a given area and hence more capacity (a larger value of C) is
              achieved. A large cluster size indicates that the ratio between the cell radius and
              the distance between co-channel cells is large. Conversely, a small cluster size
              indicates that co-channel cells are located much closer together. The value for N
              is a function of how much interference a mobile or base station can tolerate while
              maintaining a sufficient quality of communications. From a design viewpoint,
              the smallest possible value of N is desirable in order to maximize capacity over a
              given coverage area (i.e.. to maximize C in equation (2.2)). The frequency reuse
              factor of a cellular system is given by I /N, since each cell within a cluster is
              only assigned II'N of the total available channels in the system.</p>
